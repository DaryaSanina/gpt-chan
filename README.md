# gpt-chan
A GPT-3-based assistant in a form of a cute anime girl (possible upgrade to GPT-4 in the near future)

This version does not have a GUI and works in the command prompt. It listens to the user's microphone and recognizes what they say. Then it sends the user's prompt to ChatGPT and asks it to answer as an anime girl. Then the program prints ChatGPT's answer to the user's prompt and voices it. These actions repeat until the user closes the program.

2. Run main.py
3. A command prompt should open
4. When the program prints "Listening...", voice your query
5. The program will print and voice ChatGPT's response
6. The program will repeat steps 4 and 5 until you stop it by closing the command prompt.
